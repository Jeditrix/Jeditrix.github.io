                    ✨ On Semantic Compression

                    When thinking of the manner by which we compress our thoughts into semantic structures in order to convey them to others, I found a neat analogue that seems to help. 
                    If We Imagine the manner by which we translate our ideas whether they be in the imagination(Pictoral), already semantic(maybe loosly so), or even not fully realized(via the sub or unconcious),
                    There seems to take place a mechanism by which we compress the ideas into word form that is ready and accessible to others. The tricky part is figuring out which Compression algorithm to use.
                    It seems that one want's to construct a semantic bridge with enough robustness in order to preserve the fidelity of the idea, but also with enough clarity so that the recipient can also share in 
                    that fidelity. The issue seems to be in the Mis-match of compression/decompression mechanisms. If my mechanism of compression doesn't match up with the recipients mechanism of decompression, It would seem
                    that the original Idea won't be preserved. The even more difficult part is knowing the degree by which the fidelity of the original idea is held within the recipients mind, Since They could have a 
                    completely different level of resolition than intended(or even a completely diffent image)! It would seem difficult to resolve this since the manner by which they would relay the fidelity of the recived
                    Idea is by traversing back along the semantic bridge originally created, so, it would seem that the epistemic basis by which the shared fidelity of the idea is concernced lies in finding the approprietly shared
                    compression and decompression algorithm prior to constructing that semantic bridge. I will call this Aproxomating universal methods of constructing semantic bridges of shared understanding.
